# Godot steam launcher
An application for launching Godot from Steam without the "usage time" bug.

# Why?
I created this application because when you download and install Godot from Steam, The usage time will not be recorded so this application stays opened for letting Steam record the time.

# How to install?

**Note**: This application is only made for Windows, I don't have any idea if this works on other platforms.

1. Download [Godot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/Godot_Engine/) from Steam
2. Download the last binary [from releases](https://github.com/ElCosmoXD/godot-steam-launcher/releases)
3. Copy the original executable name (could be something like godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe, godot.windows.opt.tools.32.exe and so on)
4. Rename the original godot executable to: "godot.exe"
5. Rename the "godot-steam-launcher.exe" executable to the original godot executable name (As mentioned above it could be something like godot.windows.opt.tools.64.exe, godot.windows.opt.tools.32.exe and so on).
6. Launch godot from Steam
